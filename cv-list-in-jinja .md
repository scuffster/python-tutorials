how would I use a Jinja template to format the data and generate the final repo

o use a Jinja template to format the data and generate the final report, you'll need to do the following:

First, you'll need to install the Jinja2 library, which is a Python library for working with templates. You can install it using pip install Jinja2.
Next, you'll need to create a Jinja template file that defines the structure of the report. The template should contain placeholders for the data that will be injected into the report. For example, the template might look something like this:

```
<html>
  <head>
    <title>SKOS Concept Schemes</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>SKOS Concept Schemes</h1>
    <ul>
      {% for concept_scheme, label in concept_schemes %}
      <li>{{ concept_scheme }}: {{ label }}</li>
      {% endfor %}
    </ul>
  </body>
</html>
```


In your Python code, you'll need to use the Jinja2 library to render the template and inject the data into the placeholders. To do this, you'll need to do the following:
Load the template file using the jinja2.Environment class.
Use the render() method of the template object to render the template and pass in the data as variables.
Save the rendered template to a file or print it to the console.
Here's an example of how you might do this:

```
import jinja2

# Load the template file
env = jinja2.Environment(loader=jinja2.FileSystemLoader('templates'))
template = env.get_template('report.html')

# Render the template and pass in the data
concept_schemes = [("scheme1", "Label 1"), ("scheme2", "Label 2")]
output = template.render(concept_schemes=concept_schemes)

# Save the rendered template to a file
with open('report.html', 'w') as f:
    f.write(output)

```

how would that report code be structured if it were being rendered as a flask route returning the results of the SPARQL query? 


Here's an example of how you might structure the code to render the report as a Flask route that returns the results of the SPARQL query:

```
from flask import Flask, render_template
import rdflib
import jinja2

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/report')
def generate_report():
    # Connect to the Fuseki instance and execute the SPARQL query
    g = rdflib.Graph()
    g.parse("http://localhost:3030/ds/query")
    query = """
        PREFIX skos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#>
        PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

        SELECT ?concept_scheme ?label
        WHERE {
          ?concept_scheme a skos:ConceptScheme .
          ?concept_scheme rdfs:label ?label .
        }
    """
    results = g.query(query)
    
    # Extract the concept schemes and labels from the results
    concept_schemes = [(r['concept_scheme'], r['label']) for r in results]
    
    # Load the Jinja template and render the report
    env = jinja2.Environment(loader=jinja2.FileSystemLoader('templates'))
    template = env.get_template('report.html')
    output = template.render(concept_schemes=concept_schemes)
    
    # Return the rendered report as the response
    return output

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```


This code defines a Flask route that connects to the Fuseki instance, executes the SPARQL query to retrieve the SKOS concept schemes and labels, and then uses a Jinja template to generate the report. The rendered report is returned as the response to the route.

and how would the report.html jinja template look for this?

Here's an example of what the report.html Jinja template might look like in this case:

```
<html>
  <head>
    <title>SKOS Concept Schemes</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>SKOS Concept Schemes</h1>
    <ul>
      {% for concept_scheme, label in concept_schemes %}
      <li>{{ concept_scheme }}: {{ label }}</li>
      {% endfor %}
    </ul>
  </body>
</html>
```


This template defines the structure of the report, with placeholders for the data that will be injected into the report. The {% for %} loop iterates over the concept_schemes list and generates a list item for each concept scheme and label.



Here's a SPARQL query that you can use to find the concept scheme and the named graph it is in:

```
PREFIX skos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT ?concept_scheme ?graph
WHERE {
  GRAPH ?graph {
    ?concept_scheme a skos:ConceptScheme .
  }
}

```

This query retrieves the concept schemes and the named graphs they are in by using the GRAPH keyword to specify that the ?concept_scheme must be in the named graph ?graph.
