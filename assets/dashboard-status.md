how would I connect to the sparql endpoint for a fuseki dataset called "skosmos" and query   how many skos concepts exist in the dataset, using python?
To connect to the SPARQL endpoint for a Fuseki dataset and query it using Python, you can use the SPARQLWrapper package. Here is an example of how to do this:

```
from SPARQLWrapper import SPARQLWrapper, JSON

# Set the endpoint URL
sparql = SPARQLWrapper("http://your-fuseki-server:3030/skosmos/query")

# Set the query string
query = """
    SELECT (COUNT(*) AS ?count)
    WHERE {
        ?concept a skos:Concept .
    }
"""

# Set the query format to JSON
sparql.setReturnFormat(JSON)

# Set the query
sparql.setQuery(query)

# Send the query and get the results
results = sparql.query().convert()

# Print the count
print(results["results"]["bindings"][0]["count"]["value"])
```

This will print out the number of concepts in the "skosmos" dataset.

Note: You will need to install the SPARQLWrapper package using pip install SPARQLWrapper. You may also need to replace "http://your-fuseki-server:3030/skosmos/query" with the actual URL of your SPARQL endpoint.

how do I add the skos prefix to that sparql query?
To add the skos prefix to a SPARQL query, you can include a PREFIX clause at the beginning of the query. For example:

```
query = """
PREFIX skos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#>

SELECT (COUNT(*) AS ?count)
WHERE {
    ?concept a skos:Concept .
}
"""
```
This will add the skos prefix to the query, allowing you to use the skos:Concept predicate in the WHERE clause.

Note: The PREFIX clause should be followed by a prefix label (in this case, skos) and a namespace URI (in this case, http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#). The prefix label can then be used as a shorthand for the namespace URI in the rest of the query.


what would be the sparql to list all graphs in the fuseki dataset "skosmos"
To list all the named graphs in a Fuseki dataset, you can use the following SPARQL query:

```
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?graph
WHERE {
    GRAPH ?graph { ?s ?p ?o }
}

```

This query will select all the named graphs in the dataset that contain at least one triple.

To run this query on a Fuseki dataset called "skosmos", you can use the SPARQLWrapper package in Python as follows:


```
from SPARQLWrapper import SPARQLWrapper, JSON

# Set the endpoint URL
sparql = SPARQLWrapper("http://your-fuseki-server:3030/skosmos/query")

# Set the query string
query = """
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT ?graph
WHERE {
    GRAPH ?graph { ?s ?p ?o }
}
"""

# Set the query format to JSON
sparql.setReturnFormat(JSON)

# Set the query
sparql.setQuery(query)

# Send the query and get the results
results = sparql.query().convert()

# Print the graph names
for result in results["results"]["bindings"]:
    print(result["graph"]["value"])

```

This will print the names of all the named graphs in the "skosmos" dataset.

Note: You will need to install the SPARQLWrapper package using pip install SPARQLWrapper. You may also need to replace "http://your-fuseki-server:3030/skosmos/query" with the actual URL of your SPARQL endpoint.


what would the sparql be if we wanted to count how many graphs there are?
To count the number of named graphs in a Fuseki dataset, you can use the following SPARQL query:

```
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT (COUNT(?graph) AS ?count)
WHERE {
    GRAPH ?graph { ?s ?p ?o }
}

```
This query will count the number of named graphs in the dataset that contain at least one triple.

To run this query on a Fuseki dataset called "skosmos", you can use the SPARQLWrapper package in Python as follows:


```
from SPARQLWrapper import SPARQLWrapper, JSON

# Set the endpoint URL
sparql = SPARQLWrapper("http://your-fuseki-server:3030/skosmos/query")

# Set the query string
query = """
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT (COUNT(?graph) AS ?count)
WHERE {
    GRAPH ?graph { ?s ?p ?o }
}
"""

# Set the query format to JSON
sparql.setReturnFormat(JSON)

# Set the query
sparql.setQuery(query)

# Send the query and get the results
results = sparql.query().convert()

# Print the count
print(results["results"]["bindings"][0]["count"]["value"])

```

This will print the number of named graphs in the "skosmos" dataset.

Note: You will need to install the SPARQLWrapper package using pip install SPARQLWrapper. You may also need to replace "http://your-fuseki-server:3030/skosmos/query" with the actual URL of your SPARQL endpoint.

I think that SPARQL will count the number of triples in named graphs, not the number of named graphs in the dataset that contain at least one triple. I think it needs to have  "distinct ?graph" added to get the count of graphs
You are correct that the query I provided would count the number of triples in the named graphs, rather than the number of named graphs. To count the number of named graphs in the dataset, you can use the DISTINCT keyword as follows:

```
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT (COUNT(DISTINCT ?graph) AS ?count)
WHERE {
    GRAPH ?graph { ?s ?p ?o }
}
```

This query will count the number of distinct named graphs in the dataset that contain at least one triple.

To run this query on a Fuseki dataset called "skosmos", you can use the SPARQLWrapper package in Python as follows:


```
from SPARQLWrapper import SPARQLWrapper, JSON

# Set the endpoint URL
sparql = SPARQLWrapper("http://your-fuseki-server:3030/skosmos/query")

# Set the query string
query = """
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

SELECT (COUNT(DISTINCT ?graph) AS ?count)
WHERE {
    GRAPH ?graph { ?s ?p ?o }
}
"""

# Set the query format to JSON
sparql.setReturnFormat(JSON)

# Set the query
sparql.setQuery(query)

# Send the query and get the results
results = sparql.query().convert()

# Print the count
print(results["results"]["bindings"][0]["count"]["value"])
```


This will print the number of named graphs in the "skosmos" dataset that contain at least one triple.

Note: You will need to install the SPARQLWrapper package using pip install SPARQLWrapper. You may also need to replace "http://your-fuseki-server:3030/skosmos/query" with the actual URL of your SPARQL endpoint.
